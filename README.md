# Sleep-Apnea-N3-Scoring
A Python module to score N3 (deep) sleep from EEG recordings following AASM guidelines.  This module focuses specifically on detecting slow-wave activity (SWA, 0.5â€“2 Hz) in the F4-M1 EEG channel and scoring epochs as N3 or Not N3 based on the proportion of slow waves in the epoch.
